## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

This approach keep track of the max element from the beginning when the value is first push in to the stack. If the number is greater then the current max element then make the maxEle to be the new number.

## Big O

Time: O(1)

Space: O(1)
