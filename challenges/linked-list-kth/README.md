## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

This approach uses two pointers. One pointer is set to the head of the linked list and the second pointer pointing to the Kth node from the head. Loop till the second pointer gets to the end of the linked list. The first pointer will then be the Kth node from the end tail of the list.
